Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan back in January, we have more information about the virus: how to detect the symptoms and vaccination is currently being developed. However, there are still many uncertainties:

1. We don’t know about the case fatality rate. This is mainly because we don’t know precisely the number of people who are infected, which is the denominator. 

2. We don’t know precisely how the virus spreads. Generally, it is assumed that the virus spreads mainly from person-to-person through: close contact with one another (within about 1 metre) and through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is also thought that COVID-19 can spread from contact with contaminated surfaces or objects.

3. We don’t know about the timing of infectiousness. There is evidence that the transmission can happen before onset of symptoms although commonly it is thought that people are most contagious when they are most symptomatic. This information is crucial because if we were to know the timing patterns of the transmission, we could adopt a better measure when to quarantine an infected person.

4. We don’t know whether when the weather gets warmer, the spread will slow down. 

The next question is what is happening in Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan are unique to these countries or eventually most countries will experience the spread of COVID-19. For this question, epidemiologists have estimated the worst-case scenario in the absence of mitigation measures of approximately 60% of the population would become infected (Anderson et al., 2020). Back in February 25, Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC’s National Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases in the US, has already warned, “It's not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen.” (Mckeever, 2020).

If this is likely to be the case, we learnt from an epidemiological transmission model that the public efforts should be put to flatten the epidemic curve. This point is very crucial. Many people say that COVID-19 is like seasonal flu, it is not. It is a new form of virus that none of us has antibody for it. The virus attacks the lower respiratory tract and cause shortness of breath. Since the treatment of severe lung failure caused by COVID-19 requires ventilators to help the patients breath in intensive care units (ICUs), no countries in the world have the capacity to absorb a large number of people who need ICUs at the same time. Experience from Italy shows that about 10% of all positive patients require ICUs (Lintern, 2020). Although efforts have been made to increase ICU capacity, the rapidly growing number of infected patients overloaded the healthcare system. Therefore, measures to reduce transmission to slow down the epidemic over the course of the year will significantly mitigate the impact of COVID-19.

Figure 1 presents the distribution of infectious cases with and without intervention. If the outbreak peak can be delayed, this allows the health system and healthcare professionals to match between the number of persons require hospitalisation and intensive care with the nation’s capacity to provide medical care. To flatten the epidemic curve and lower peak morbidity and mortality, this calls for both government response and individual actions (Anderson et al., 2020). 

Certainly, we will have to follow the protocol of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Health, but certain practices such as social distancing, washing hands and avoiding gathering in crowded place can help reduce the transmission. Whilst it is true that young and healthy people are less likely to get sick and die from COVID-19, they can be a virus carrier. The attached article recently published in The Lancet is very helpful for the better understanding of the situation and explains why fighting against COVID-19 is a collective action.
